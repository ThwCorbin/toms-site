Project idea: Send a monkeyCatRobot to friends.

Brief: User can make a cybernetic organism that is 1/3 monkey, 1/3 cat, and 1/3 robot. User can send the cyborg to friends via email and sundry media platforms. User can pull the handle on a [one-armed bandit](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=one-armed+bandit&title=21st 'Definition of a one-armed bandit'), and instead of random fruit, the bandit returns a monkeyCatRobot. User can swipe to switch the cyborg's different 1/3s to create a custom monkeyCatRobot. User can incorporate lobster, dog, and astroid miner body part 1/3s to build a mutant monkeyCatRobot.

Background: I wanted to make a monkeyCatRobot with SVG. Originally, I envisioned monkeys, cats, and robots, along with lobsters, dogs, and astroid miners in space. The monkeyCatRobot combined their powers to become an unstoppable force to fight space alien robot cowboy [dragoons](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=dragoon&title=21st 'Definition of a dragoon'). (I still may do that in another project.) Then I saw Phil Hawksworth's JAMstack example [Virtual Lollipop](https://vlolly.net/, 'Send a virtual lollipop to people'), and I thought, "I should make a one-armed bandit version and enable people to send monkeyCatRobots to friends." Handy if they have an extraterrestrial dragoon problem.

Status: Bioengineering proposal in committee.

Technologies: JAMstack, SVG, FaaS database
