Project idea: User makes a character that is 1/3 monkey, 1/3 cat, and 1/3 robot. User sends their monkeyCatRobot to friends via email, twitter, and sundry media platforms.

Details: User pulls the handle on a [one-armed bandit](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=one-armed+bandit&title=21st 'Definition of one-armed bandit'). Instead of random fruit, the program returns a monkeyCatRobot that the user sends to friends. (Optionally) User can select the beast's 1/3s by swiping to create a custom monkeyCatRobot.

Background: I wanted to make a monkeyCatRobot with SVG. Originally, I envisioned monkeys, cats, and robots, along with lobsters, dogs, and astroid miners in space. The monkeyCatRobot combined their powers to become an unstoppable force for good. (I still may do that in another project.) Then I saw Phil Hawksworth's JAMstack example [Virtual Lollipop](https://vlolly.net/, 'Send a virtual lollipop to people'), and I thought "I should make a one-armed bandit version and enable people to send them to friends."

Technologies: JAMstack, SVG, FaaS database
