**Project Idea:** Nominate someone as the World's Best Person

**Brief:** User can nominate someone to be named the World's Best Person. After submitting the nomination, user can send a note to the person they nominated. User can read the other nominations.

**Background:** We need more positive acts of kindness these days. I want to make an app for people to tell other people why they think they are great.

**Technologies:** Either MERN or React and Django/PostgreSQL.
