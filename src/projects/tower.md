Project: Play a game of Tower of Turtles! How many moves will it take you to move all of the turtles to a different tower? A tricky game based on [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi, "Wikipedia entry for Tower of Hanoi").

Brief: The player selects a turtle from the top of a stack. Then the player selects the tower base to which they want to move the turtle. Larger turtles cannot move on top of smaller turtles. Keep moving turtles until all of the turtles are restacked on a different tower base than they all started on.

Background: This game is my fourth project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

Status: Turtles are trying to break out of their egg block shells.
