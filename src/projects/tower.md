**Project:** Play a game of Tower of Turtles! How many moves will it take you to move all of the turtles to a different tower?

**Brief:** Users select a turtle from the top of a stack. Users select the tower base to which they want to move the turtle. Larger turtles cannot move on top of smaller turtles. Users keep moving turtles until all of the turtles are restacked on a different tower base (middle or right base).

**Background:** A game of [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi, "Wikipedia entry for Tower of Hanoi") but with turtles. This game is my fourth project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

**Technologies:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS

**Status:** Turtles all the way down.
