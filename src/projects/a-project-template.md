Project: A local weather application.

Details: User sees a snapshot of their local weather. User can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. If the user does not like their current weather, the user can improve their forecast with the "Better weather?" switch.

Background: I completed this project as a part of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/, 'freeCodeCamp website') _Front End Web Development Certification_.

Status: Cold storage.
