Project: A cocktail recipe generator.

Brief: The website presents a user five fab cocktails with tabs to select each one. User can click a button to load five more cocktails.

Background: I needed a random cocktail, so I built an app that could serve my need. This is a lab exercise that I converted into a project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

Technologies: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Status: [Chin-chin!](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/chin-chin "Collins Dictionary definition of chin-chin")
