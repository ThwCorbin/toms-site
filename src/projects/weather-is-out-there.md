Project: A local weather forecast viewer.

Brief: User sees a snapshot of their local weather. User can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. If the user does not like their current weather, the user can improve their forecast with the "Better weather?" switch.

Background: I completed this project as a part of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org 'freeCodeCamp website') _Front End Web Development Certification_. There is an [issue with the freeCodeCamp weather API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/weather-challenge-url-functioning-randomly/184650/2 'freeCodeCamp Forum post on weather API issue') provided for the project. I could go back and fix the issue with something like `if (location === Shuzenji, JP) { // do something else }`, but I like that one of my first projects randomly provides the local weather for Shuzenji, Japan. I hear the weather is nice there. And if not, try "Better weather."

Status: Cold storage.
