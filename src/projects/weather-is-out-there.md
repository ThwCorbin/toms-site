**Project:** A local weather forecast viewer.

**Brief:** User sees a snapshot of the local weather. User can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. If user does not like the current weather, user can improve the forecast with the "Better weather?" switch.

**Background:** This project was part of [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org "freeCodeCamp website") _Front End Web Development Certification_. There is an [issue with the freeCodeCamp weather API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/weather-challenge-url-functioning-randomly/184650/2 "freeCodeCamp Forum post on weather API issue") provided for the project. I could go back and fix the issue, `if(location === shuzenji, jp) // do something`, but I see it as a feature. It's fun to randomly know the weather in Shuzenji, Japan. And there's always "Better weather" a click away.

**Status:** Cold front moving through bringing more seasonable weather.
