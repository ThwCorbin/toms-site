**Project:** A trivia game using my Pub Quiz JSON API.

**Brief:** Answer trivia questions! If you don't like the questions, you can change or delete them. You can even add your own questions. You get to ask (and answer) the questions you want during Question Time!

**Background:** Question Time is a React front end that uses a MongoDB, Express, and Node.js back end that I built for an API project called [Pub Quiz](https://github.com/ThwCorbin/pub-quiz "repo on GitHub"). The JSON API I built provides access to trivia questions for a pub quiz game. The user can change or delete the question and answers. The user can add a question. The user has access to the Pub Quiz API! Scary. But fun!

**Technologies:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node.js, apiDoc

**Status:** Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know. - King Arthur
