**Project:** A schnautz card game to play online.

**Brief:** User can play [schnautz](https://www.pagat.com/commerce/schwim.html "Rules of schnautz card game") card game with friends online or with animals that resemble my pets in the game.

**Background:** My sister-out-law and her boyfriend-my-brother-out-law taught me this card game when they were visiting from England. I thought, "I should try to make this game with JavaScript. My pets could play if a user needs some friends."

**Technologies:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS

**Status:** Hold. Poor planning and design decisions led to bloated code, no plan for online card play, and circular dependency issues. But other than that, brilliant. And I learned how to [shuffle cards](https://www.thwcorbin.com/posts/shuffle-card-deck "My article on how to shuffle cards with JavaScript") with JavaScript. I need to rethink the design and decide how I will implement online card play with friends. I currently have higher priority projects/ideas, so the project will linger in this dilapidated state.
