Project: A trivia question JSON API.

Brief: Trivia questions for a [pub quiz](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=pub+quiz&title=21st "Chambers definition of pub quiz") game stored in a database that users can access via a JSON API. This version has one category: history. This is the route: `/history`. Here is the [API documentation](http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/doc "API documentation").

Background: I miss our [local](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=local&title=21st "Chambers definition of local - reference _noun_ entry 2") in England. I miss pub quizes. I made a pub quiz API to fill the void. This API is my sixth project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

Technologies: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node.js, apiDoc

Status: Next question.
