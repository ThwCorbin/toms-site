Project: A Wikipedia search bar and results viewer.

Brief: User enters a word or phrase to search for on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page 'The Free Encyclopedia'), which returns the first ten results to the user. User can click on a result to go to the Wikipedia entry. User can alternatively "throw an airplane", which takes the user to a random Wikipedia entry.

Background: If you are open to learning, the world is your lobster. My wife doesn't like oysters, so she says "...your lobster."

Status: Needs drawn butter.
