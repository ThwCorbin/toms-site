**Project:** A Wikipedia search bar and results viewer.

**Brief:** User enters a word or phrase to search on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page "The Free Encyclopedia"), which returns the first ten results to user. User can click on a result to go to the Wikipedia entry. User can "throw an airplane," which takes user to a random Wikipedia entry.

**Background:** If you are open to learning, the world is your lobster. My wife doesn't like oysters; she prefers to say "...lobster."

**Status:** Needs drawn butter.
