**Project:** Modernized non-profit website.

Brief: Modernize a non-profit's website with a React front end and a Django back end.

**Background:** Our 12-person software engineering team built Statistics Without Borders (SWB) a new website with modern technologies over eight days. SWB is a volunteer Outreach Group of the American Statistical Association that provides pro bono services in statistics and data science for public benefit with a focus on developing countries. This is my tenth and final project, and the capstone group project, for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) program.

**Technologies:** I focused on the front end along with most of the team using React, Jest, Enzyme, and Storybook. Other teammates focused on the back end using Django and PostgreSQL.

**Status:** Our team initiated the project, and the next GA SEI class will carry on from where we left off.
