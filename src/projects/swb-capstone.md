Project: Modernized non-profit website.

Brief: Modernize a non-profit's website with a React front end.

Background: Statistics Without Borders (SWB) was our client for this group project to modernize the SWB website with a React front end and a Django back end. This is my tenth and final project, and the capstone group project, for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) program.

Technologies: I focused on the front end along with most of the team using React, Jest, Enzyme, and Storybook. Other teammates focused on the back end using Django, Python, and PostgreSQL.

Status: Our team initiated the project, and the next GA SEI class will carry on from where we left off.
