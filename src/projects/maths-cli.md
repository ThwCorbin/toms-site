Project: Multiplication flash cards command line application.

Brief: A Python command line application, which provides mathematics flash cards to help a user practice multiplication.

Background: User runs the Maths-cli app in their terminal to practice the multiplication table (factors 1 through 12). User sets up a practice session with all 144 "flash cards" or selects a subset of cards. User can add multiplicaton flash cards to the database after user's first practice session. This is my ninth project, and my first Python project, for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

Technologies: Python, PostgreSQL, PeeWee

Status: 3 x 5 = ?
