Project: A calculator that does not compute for robots.

Details: User can press number and operator keys. Calculator returns accurate results to user. Calculator cannot return results to a robot user. Calculator may make comments along with some results.

Background: How do I tempt a user to try my calculator? The user surely has a perfectly good calculator on their electronic device. Perhaps, a story alluding to a robot will work. The logical not in front of compute (!Compute) can help form a double entendre: it is beyond a robot's ken, and the calculator will not work for robots. Once the user tries my calculator, I can entice them to stay with cheeky comments based on returned values. 2, "It's the loneliest number since the number one." That'll do it!

Status: Err:Nonreal Ans.
