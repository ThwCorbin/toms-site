Project: A social "inspiration" website.

Brief: Vibing is a social "inspiration" website, which is similar to social media platforms, but users only share "good vibes" with others. Users can create, read, update, and delete vibes as well as view inspirational quotes.

Background: Vibing is a React front end that uses a MongoDB, Express, and Node.js back end built for a group project. Users can create, read, update, and delete vibes. Users can sign up for an account, which generates an authentication token. Users can view inspirational quotes to get their creative vibes moving. This is my eighth project, and my first major group project, for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

Technologies: React, Storybook, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node.js

Status: Good vibes.
