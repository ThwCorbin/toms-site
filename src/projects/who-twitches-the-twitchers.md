Project: A list of [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/ 'Live streaming entertainment website') channels with their current online status.

Brief: User can see a list of Twitch.tv entertainment channels. User can see which channels are currently streaming. User can click on a channel and go watch the stream. Instead of gamer live streams, user can pick from a selection of Twitch.tv's premium streaming channels, such as [Bob Ross](https://www.twitch.tv/bobross 'The Joy of Painting'), [CONtv](https://www.twitch.tv/contv '24/7 TV and movies you never asked for'), [Cosmos](https://www.twitch.tv/cosmos 'Carl Sagan takes a personal voyage'), and [The Justin Wilson Show](https://www.twitch.tv/thejustinwilsonshow 'I garontee!').

Background: Chamber's defines a [twitcher](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=twitcher&title=21st 'Definition of twitcher') as "a bird-watcher whose aim is to spot as many rare birds as possible." When I began this [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org 'freeCodeCamp website') (FCC) project, the British word [twitcher](https://www.britishbirdlovers.co.uk/bird-watching-for-beginners/what-is-a-twitcher 'Article on twitchers') came to mind, and I thought I should [twitch](https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=twitch&title=thes 'Thesaurus entry for twitch'), as in tweak, the Twitch.tv Twitchers. I'm not much of a gamer, so I decided to look for rare entertainment gems available on Twitch.tv. Sadly, the FCC Twitch API is no longer working. I liked this project so much, I memorialized it here anyway. Open the image above in a new tab to view a shadow of this project's full feathered glory.
