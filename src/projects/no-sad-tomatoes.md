Project: A [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique 'Wikipedia entry for the Pomodoro Technique time management method') that prefers playtime.

Brief: User can start a work timer to manage how long to work before taking a break. When play timer reaches zero, work timer starts again. User can change the work and play minutes. User can pause and reset timer. User can press sad tomato face to activate happy tomato face playtime.

Background: The play timer should have a bigger share of our lives. We only get one tomato! Don't let your tomato run you down. Reset it. A few rays of sunshine can turn sad tomatoes into a happy bunch of tomatoes playing in the sun. Bring colors out of the vegetable garden to make your tomato fresh and lively.

Status: Right ray of sunshine.
