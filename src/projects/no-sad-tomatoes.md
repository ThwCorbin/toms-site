Project: A [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique 'Wikipedia entry for the Pomodoro Technique time management method') that prefers playtime.

Brief: User can start a timer to manage how long user works before taking a break. When work timer reaches zero, play timer starts. When play timer reaches zero, work timer starts. Pomodoro timer runs continuously until user turns timer off. User can change the work and play minutes. User can pause and reset timer. User can press sad tomato face to activate happy tomato face, which changes work timer to 5 minutes and play timer to 85 minutes.

Background: The play timer should have a bigger share of our lives. We only get one tomato! Don't let your tomato run you down. Reset it. A few rays of sunshine can turn sad tomatoes into a happy bunch of tomatoes playing in the sun. Bring colors out of the vegetable garden to make your tomato fresh and lively.

Status: Right ray of sunshine.
