**Project:** A Bacon Dynamo that ouputs random meat quotes from random folks.

**Brief:** User clicks a button to display a random quote. User is able to read a random quote about meat that the Bacon Dynamo attributes to a random fictional name. User can click multiple times for multiple quotes. User can tweet the meat quote.

**Background:** Who wants to read quotes from dead people? I'd rather reflect on rashers. [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/ "A meatier lorem ipsum generator") called to me. I oinked. But I needed names. Ah, yes: [UINames](https://uinames.com/ "A simple tool to generate fake names for use in designs and mockups."). A [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org "freeCodeCamp website") project with streaky bacon.

**Status:** Mmmm.
