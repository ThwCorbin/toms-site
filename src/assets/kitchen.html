	<h2>What's for tea?</h2>

	<p>
		The kitchen is about what I'm cooking at the moment. This week, I'm
		JAMStacking my website with a blog, updated projects, and a new theme. My
		blog will help supply the kitchen, where I'll dish out the latest about what
		I'm working on and where I'm heading.
	</p>

	<p>
		HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my cookbooks. Creativity, curiosity, and a sense of
		humor shape my recipes. My experiences leading and collaborating with teams over the last twenty-odd
		years provide seasoning.
	</p>

	<p>
		Learning is my focus. Finding a web development job that stretches my skills
		is my immediate goal. I probably fit best on the front end, but I'm open to
		all opportunites that expand my knowledge. If you need a Junior Web Developer (or you'd
		like to chat over a cuppa), contact me via the links below.
